# Java-Inheritance-Project
A Java project I did for a university assignment where I used Inheritance and scored 38/38.
I first had to download the starter code and then began editing the code and working along the instructions.
This project taught me:
How to reuse code across classes by inheriting fields and methods from a super type.
How to customize an inherited method (overriding).
How to reuse code across classes by combining objects (composition).
How to document the behaviour of your classes to make them easier to use (Javadoc comments).
